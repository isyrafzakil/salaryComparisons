Job   seekers   need   to   have   information   about   the   wages paid   in   their   geographic   area   so   that   they   can   negotiate   their   starting   salaries.   Many   first   time employees   do   not   negotiate   a   salary   and   are   not   sure   what   the   rate   of   pay   is   for   the   particular   position in   that   geographic   area.
